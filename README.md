# 🐊 Akigator - Interactive Web Application with Machine Learning  

Akigator is an intelligent guessing game inspired by Akinator, where the computer asks questions to guess what you're thinking. Built using **Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and a relational database**, it leverages **machine learning principles** to refine its guesses over time.  

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **Interactive Q&A System** – The computer asks a series of questions to deduce your answer.  
✅ **Machine Learning Enhancement** – The system improves over time based on past answers.  
✅ **User Authentication** – Secure login and game session tracking.  
✅ **Game History** – Review previous sessions and results.  
✅ **Admin Panel** – Manage questions, categories, and game logic.  

## 🎯 Project Goals  

1️⃣ **Concept & Idea** – Brainstorming and defining core functionality.  
2️⃣ **Initial Implementation** – Setting up backend logic, database, and basic UI.  
3️⃣ **Refinement & UX Enhancements** – Improving AI accuracy and refining the interface.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security  
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, Bootstrap  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Authentication**: Spring Security  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
